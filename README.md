# Rock-Paper-Scissor-AI-Game

### Project Overview

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple game that is often played as a party game or a way to pass the time. The goal of the game is to choose one of three hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors) that will beat the other player's gesture. In this project, we will build an AI game that can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against a human player.

### Project Goals

The specific goals of this project are to:

Build a computer vision model that can recognize rock, paper, and scissors gestures.

Build an AI agent that can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against a human player.

Create a user interface that allows the human player to play against the AI agent.

### Project Approach

The project will be implemented using the following steps:

Build a computer vision model that can recognize rock, paper, and scissors gestures. This can be done using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.

Build an AI agent that can play Rock-Paper-Scissors. This can be done using a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as a decision tree or a neural network.

Create a user interface that allows the human player to play against the AI agent. This can be done using a variety of graphical user interface (GUI) libraries, such as PyQt or Tkinter. I used Tkinter here.

### Project Deliverables

The deliverables of this project will be:

A Jupyter notebook containing the code for building the computer vision model, the AI agent, and the user interface.

A video demonstration of the AI agent playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against a human player.
